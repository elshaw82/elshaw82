# Hi! I'm Elaine

After 10 brilliant years in Digital Marketing, I realised that the aspects of my job I loved the most were the ones in which I got to bury my head in code ðŸš€

I've spent my time in lockdown doing the #100DaysOfCode challenge in order to kickstart my Frontend Developer journey!

I'm nearing the end of R1 where I really focussed on learning JavaScript: next up - React, Bootstrap and Sass

I love great design, CSS, weird animations and The National. Pasta addict. She/Her.
